# Self_Organization
The molecular mechanisms of self-organization that orchestrate embryonic cells
to create astonishing patterns have been among major questions of developmental
biology. It is recently shown that embryonic stem cells (ESCs), when cultured on
particular micropatterns, can self-organize and mimic early steps of pre-implantation
embryogenesis. A systems-biology model to address this observation from a dynamical
systems perspective is essential. Here, we propose a multicellular mathematical model
for pattern formation during in vitro gastrulation of human ESCs. This model enhances
the basic principles of Waddington epigenetic landscape with cell-cell communication,
in order to enable pattern and tissue formation. To prevent overfitting of the model,
there is a minimal number of parameters in the model, which are sufficient to address
different experimental observations such as the formation of three germ layers and
trophectoderm, responses to altered culture conditions and micropattern diameters,
and unexpected spotted forms of the germ layers under certain conditions. This model
provides a basis for in-silico modeling of self-organization.
